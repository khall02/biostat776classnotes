## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r} 
#vectors
#logical: True/ False
#character: letters
#numeric: integer, double

#Lists have lists inside of them! 

#numeric, c stands for concatenate 
x<-c(.5,.6)
#logical 
x<-c(TRUE, FALSE)
#character
x<-c("a", "b","c")
#integer 
X<-9:29

#lists allow you to have diff types of vars


```

## Lists, c function wont let you have diff type of variables


```{r}
koko.list<- list(1.5, "koko")
typeof(4)
x<- sqrt(2)^2
x

y<-c(1.7, "a")
y<-c(TRUE,2)
y<-c("a", TRUE)

x<- 0:6
class(x)


#convert x to numeric: 
as.numeric(x)

#convert to LOGic 
as.logical(x)

#convert to character:
as.character(x)
```

```{r}
#matrices have dimension
m<-matrix(1:6,nrow=2, ncol=3)
#demensions
dim(m)
#attributes
attributes(m)
m

m<- 1:10
dim(m)<- c(2,5)


x<-1:3
y<-10:12
cbind(x,y)

```

```{r}
#factor
x<-factor(c("yes", "yes", "yes", "no"))
x

table(x)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
