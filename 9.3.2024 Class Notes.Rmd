knitr::write_bib("rmarkdown", file="class_demo.bib")

I have been using Rmarkdown package (@R-rmarkdown) -@R-rmarkdown

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
list.files()
```

## Include citation list at the end

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
install.packages(c("bibtex", "RefManageR"))
```

```{r}
citation("tidyverse")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
