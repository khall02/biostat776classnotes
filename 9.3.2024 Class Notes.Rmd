```{r}
#packages need a citation
citation("rmarkdown")
#can also use Zotero- citation manager 
#for bibtech create a new bib
knitr::write_bib("rmarkdown", file="class_demo.bib")
```

I have been using Rmarkdown package (@R-rmarkdown) -@R-rmarkdown

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
list.files()
```

## Include citation list at the end

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
install.packages(c("bibtex", "RefManageR"))
```

```{r}
citation("tidyverse")
```


Section 7: Reading and Writing DAta 

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
#reltative paths
setwd("../data")
#up one folder is ..
```

```{r}
#here package helsp you locate file, here::here looks where you are right now- finds the root of our project 
here::here()
#This will set the working directory in class notes, in the folder R 
setwd("R")
```

```{r}
library("here")
list.files(here::here())
list.files(here("data"))

```
#read in csv files from folder "Data"
here("COMPS", "team_standings.csv")
#assign it to an object "standings", can see this in viewer panel 
#to use here you need .RProj or Git in the same directory
standings<-read.csv(here:("data","team_standings.csv" ))
#you can:
view(standings)
#to pick out specific column: 
standings$Team
```

```{r}
#read in an R file using "source"
source(here::here("R", "2024--09-29.R"),
       echo=TRUE)
```

#saving your files 
#RData stores multiple R objects
#.Rda stoers the short for .RDAta and is equivilant 
# .Rds stores a single R object 

```{r}
x<- 1:5
save(x, file=here("data", "x.Rda"))
```

#reassign the saved object previously! 
```{r}
newx2<- load(here("data", "x.Rda"))
newx2
```

```{r}
x<-rnorm(5)
#verbose= TRUE- what are the objects that you laoded? 
```

```{r}
#remove files 
file.remove(here("data", "x.Rda"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
